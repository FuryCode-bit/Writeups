## Don't Touch My Fone

## Solution

Listening carefully to the audio, it wasn't morse code or SSTV â€” it sounded like **DTMF tones**!
To decode the signal, I used the **DTMF decoder** available at [http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html) or [https://dtmf.netlify.app/](https://dtmf.netlify.app/). 

I uploaded the audio to the website and it decoded the sequence of tones into numbers and letters.

After decoding, this is what appeared:

```
FLAG: DawgCTF{4104553500}
```
