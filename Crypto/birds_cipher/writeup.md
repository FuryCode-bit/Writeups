## Challenge: Birds

### Cryptography

### Description

I noticed a strange arrangement of symbols that looked like birds sitting on a wire. Can you decode it?

### Solution

This puzzle was not a traditional cipher, it was a **Birds on a Wire Cipher**.

To solve it, I used the **Birds on a Wire decoder** tool available at [https://www.dcode.fr/birds-on-a-wire-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/birds-on-a-wire-cipher).

By inputting the arrangement into the decoder, I retrieved the hidden message.

Hereâ€™s what I found:

```
FLAG: DawgCTF{there_is_no_escape}
```
