## Reverse Engineering:

### Description

The supercomputing center just put out a program that checks physics theories for correctness. Can you figure out the answer to the universe and everything?

This challenge is from the March 2024 Flash CTF. It was first solved 2.7 minutes into the competition by Ph3enx. 74.2% of active users solved it during the competition.
